1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
#At the begining of the line



2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs?

b/a                 =2.5
b//a                =2 floor cuts off deciml
b**a                =25 times it like b^a
b%a                 =1 modulus (the remainder) so 10/3=3 remainder 1
a+B                 =7
type(42)            =<class 'int'> meaning the number is an interger
type(42.0)          =float
type("C3PO")        =string
type(True)          = error, true is not defined and it is a statement.



3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7

a             =15.0
type(a)       =float



4.) Fix the mistake in the following code.
x,y = (4,5)
a = 3(x + y)
a = 3*(x+y)






5.) Fix the code so it will calculate the average.
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave = (x+y+z)/3
